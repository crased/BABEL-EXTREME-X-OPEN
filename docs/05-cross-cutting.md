# Cross-Cutting Concerns

> Confidence scoring rules and `needs_review` semantics are defined in [`./output-schema.md`](./output-schema.md). The thresholds shown below are illustrative.

## Error Handling & Confidence Scoring

```python
@dataclass
class ProcessingResult:
    success: bool
    data: Any
    confidence: float  # 0.0 - 1.0
    warnings: List[str]
    errors: List[str]
    needs_review: bool  # Flag for human review queue
    
class ConfidenceThresholds:
    OCR_MIN = 0.85          # Below this, flag text for review
    TRANSLATION_MIN = 0.80   # Below this, flag translation
    LAYOUT_MIN = 0.90        # Below this, flag structure
    OVERALL_MIN = 0.75       # Below this, page needs manual review
```

## Parallel Processing Strategy

```python
class PipelineOrchestrator:
    """
    Manages parallel processing across pipeline stages.
    
    Parallelization strategy:
    - Stage 1 (Ingestion): Pages processed in parallel
    - Stage 2 (Extraction): Pages processed in parallel
    - Stage 3 (Translation): Batched API calls with rate limiting
    - Stage 4 (Reconstruction): Pages processed in parallel
    """
    
    def __init__(self, config: OrchestratorConfig):
        self.max_workers = config.max_workers
        self.batch_size = config.batch_size
        self.rate_limiter = RateLimiter(config.api_rate_limit)
```

## Caching & Checkpointing

```yaml
caching:
  # Cache extracted structures to avoid re-OCR on retry
  extraction_cache:
    enabled: true
    backend: "sqlite"  # or "redis" for distributed
    ttl_hours: 168     # 1 week
    
  # Checkpoint after each stage for resume capability
  checkpointing:
    enabled: true
    storage: "./checkpoints/{job_id}/"
    stages: ["ingestion", "extraction", "translation", "reconstruction"]
```
